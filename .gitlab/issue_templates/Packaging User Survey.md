# Packaging User Survey

<!--
## Purpuse of the questions

The aim of this user survey is to identify issues within the current system,
categorize different packager usages and their interactions, and uncover edge
cases and challenges with specific package stacks.

We seek to gather insights that will help craft user stories, particularly
focusing on documenting and understanding what current problems packagers are
facing and how these could be prioritized.

Additionally, we want to understand the difficulties users are facing today and
explore their vision of an ideal system, free from existing constraints and
legacy influences. This is particularily useful to envision an long term goal
and apply an iterative approach, proposing individual RFC's moving step by step
towards this goal, while building upon an appropriate foundation.
