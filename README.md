# buildbtw

A service for assisting Arch Linux staff with building new versions of packages.

## Roadmap

1. [Collect initial user stories](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/buildbtw/-/milestones/1)
1. [Do some exploratory hacking](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/buildbtw/-/milestones/2) to validate our approach for the tricky parts
1. [Write RFC, outlining major components & architecture](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/buildbtw/-/milestones/3)
1. [Build and deploy MVP](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/buildbtw/-/milestones/4)
1. [Work on milestones one-by-one to improve the service](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/buildbtw/-/milestones)

The exploratory hacking will produce some code. This is only to gain a better understanding of the tradeoffs involved in the components and functionality we'll propose in the RFC. 
Once the RFC is approved, we'll throw away the exploratory code and start work on a permanent codebase.

## Project Management

We're using the issue tracker for requirements and user stories. 
Information on prior art, technical background, feedback from user interviews and other notes are gathered in the [notes](./notes) folder. 

## FAQ

It's pronounced "buildbytheway".
